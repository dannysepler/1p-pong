### Basics about the game:
- All of the javascript currently exists on one file (scripts/initial.js)
- Uses a "canvas" -- an element of HTML5
- Written in pure javascript code, NO FRAMEWORKS

### Instructions
- click the game to begin
- use up and down arrow keys to navigate the bumper
- will increment every time the ball hits the bumper

### Future aspirations
- high scores, using Google Docs as a database
- making mobile friendly (maybe sliding finger to move bumper?)

### Known bugs
- sometimes it can end up as infinite loop in which ball hits bumper in same exact location every time
